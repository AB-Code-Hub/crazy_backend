- **🌐 RESTful API**: A well-structured set of RESTful API endpoints for managing resources efficiently.
- **💾 Database Integration**: Seamless integration with **MongoDB** (using Mongoose) for storing and managing data.
- **🛠️ Error Handling**: Robust error handling and request validation to ensure smooth API interactions.
- **📝 Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring, debugging, and maintaining the application.
- **⚙️ Environment Configuration**: Configurable environment settings for different stages (development, production, testing) using `.env` files.
- **📈 Scalability**: Designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, making it easy to add new features and scale as needed.
